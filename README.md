# GRD_CMT3D
Source mechansim inversion based on 3D Greens functions:

CMT3D/ -- linearized moment-tensor inversions using 3D Greens functions (GFs). The number of GF simulations needed is the
number of source parameters (9 = 6 moment tensor elements + 3 location parameters).

GRD3D/ -- grid search over strike, dip, rake and event magnitude for the best source mechanism.  This is usually used to provide a
a robust starting solution if the one from the catalog is not very reliable.
